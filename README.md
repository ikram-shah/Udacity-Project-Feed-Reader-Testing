# udacity-project-feed-reader-testing

For Feed Reader Testing project, which is a part of Udacity Frontend Web Development Nanodegree.

## What is this?

This project was focused to use the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) testing suite, to write validations against some simple RSS feed application. This has to be running on a local system to validate.

## How to run this?

By getting started with the unit testing, open up `index.html` in a browser. A feedreader app is visible along with the Jasmine testing, which is present at the bottom of the same page. No errors will be seen if all the tests are performed well.
